\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this Hazard Analysis document is to examine the MobiCharged Project in its stage of development to outline all potential hazards. These hazards include, but are not limited to safety risks, areas of failure and security issues. Along with the highlighted areas of potential hazards, solutions to remove these issues (or mitigate these issues at best) will be outlined.

\subsection{Background}
Engineers are tasked with design in construction to exceed requirements without hindering safety. Safety is a topic that is never missed within the industry and is continuously being highlighted amongst designs; especially as Engineers are reminded of their moral obligations to society by their awarded rings upon graduation. 
\par
As a current process, the construction industry places sensors within concrete spaces to continuously test and/or monitor the integrity of buildings during as well as after construction. Ultimately however, these sensors run out of battery and are required to be re-charged. 
The industry still faces challenges when attempting to charge these sensors with the method of remote charging as the current products that satisfy remote charging abilities are yet to be optimized. There are a significant number of buildings being built in the GreaterToronto-Area, which is emphasized considering that 70\% of cranes within Canada are in just the GTA alone. To place innovation in the sub-field of safety within the industry, it is indeed a requirement to modernize the ability of producing efficient remote charging systems and to have the design process optimized to provide the most effective results.
\par
The system-solution for this will be the development of MobiCharged. This system is separated into two separate components - the software for users as well as the hardware / prototype. 
The software component of MobiCharged is a machine-learned system that will react to the input of users (in which the input will be the desired outputs / application requirements for the remote charging device) and provide the necessary results (these variables depending on the user inputs can be antenna types, layouts, wavelengths, phases, etc.)  in order to satisfy the user’s inputs such that they may proceed with producing the devices in a way that it is optimized. This software can be operated in any environment the user chooses such that it can be used in any computing system with sufficient speed, memory & the required processors. 
\par
The hardware component of MobiCharged is a prototype to be developed for the purpose of demonstration as well as development for the software. This physical component will allow the system to be rooted to the core optimization problem in the real world, as it applies to real products. The physical system will allow placing absolute constraints and limitations into the software for optimal outputs in the software. In addition, this physical system can be implemented for an actual use-case in the field post-demonstrations. 

\subsection{Scope}
The environments in which these physical systems operate are typically from roof-tops and/or high-altitude locations with spacial capabilities to place arrays of these systems. These systems react to user inputted (remotely) data such as the location of the device required to be charged, so that it may orient itself in a manner optimal for that application. 
\par
The purpose of the software system, MobiCharge, is a machine learning algorithm that will be used by Mobilite-Power, engineering consultant groups, general contractors and building maintenance teams to optimize the design process required to effectively and efficiently produce the most viable remote charging system. In doing so, this will negate the current process of manually conducting simulations (that requires lengthy computerized numerical calculations), ultimately minimizing cost, manual labor, and the time necessary to produce the required results. 
\par
This system will provide users with the optimal configuration of a remote charging device based on the desired output, encrypt data protecting users when producing design results and use data smoothing to ensure the accuracy of the system in a time efficient manner.
\par
The purpose of the hardware system is to root our algorithms optimization in the real world environment. The production of a physical model will assist in the determination of the absolute boundaries that can be fed into the machine learning algorithm. Variable parameter ranges will be able to be derived from the physical model to determine the magnitude to which the boundaries can be pushed within the simulation. 
The physical system provides a secondary purpose in the form of data collection and verification. In order to increase the breadth of data that we can feed into the algorithm, we must determine the degree of computational error within the simulation results. A physical model will aid in determining this range and lead to further optimization through the machine learning algorithm.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is an assumption that the developers will eventually have access to enough processing power to conduct large quantities of simulations.
    \item A large underlying assumption regarding this system is that the user does not intentionally attempt to enter inputs incorrectly, as well as provide positive feedback to the system when it is not correct.

\end{itemize}


\section{Component Overview}

\subsection{Software System}
\subsubsection{Front End User Display}
The Front End User Display component is the component in which the user is able to view. This area is where the user navigates through the software, log-in their accounts, enters inputs, requests data and/or verification, and receives outputs.

\subsubsection{Back-End Calculations}
The Back-End Calculations component of the software system is for the computerized calculations to occur based on the user’s inputs. Note that this does not refer to simulations; this component is merely where the user’s inputs are calculated to higher level variables such that the software may then be used to process to create outputs. 

\subsubsection{Machine-Learning Algorithm}
The Machine-Learning component of this software system is where the system receives feedback either from the outputs themselves, or from the user in regards to desirable solutions. The more positive feedback it receives, the more of these inputs the system will retain. Similarly, the more negative feedback the system receives, the less of those specific inputs it will retain. As the system continues to learn, the concept of the system providing suggestions, limitations and of course the optimal solutions will become present. 

\subsubsection{Data Exporting}
The Data Exporting component of the software system is the area of the software system where it exports the results. This not only refers to merely outputting the data to the front-end display component, but also refers to exporting into desirable file systems to be stored as well as encryption processes during transfer. 

\subsubsection{Server}
The Server component will be used to maximize the training available to the machine learner, by having the simulations run on local machines, and passing the data via the online connections to an isolated machine and database, which will encapsulate the Machine-Learning Algorithm component. This will be in a future iteration of the design.

\subsubsection{Simulation Integration Software}
This component encompasses the pre-existing Matlab simulations with which we will integrate our machine learning algorithm, and the software required to integrate them. It will likely involve a database system as well as kernel modules for real-time polling of said database(s), with a dynamic scheduler. 

\subsection{Hardware Systems}
\subsubsection{Power Supply System}
The purpose of the power supply system component is to provide usable power to subsequent systems. 

\subsubsection{Phase-Shift System}
This component will work to provide the phase shift required for the antenna array system to properly create wave required interference. The purpose of this is to facilitate constructive interference at the desired location for charging. 

\subsubsection{Antenna-Array System}
This component will contain multiple small arrays and will work in conjunction with the Power Supply system and Phase-Shift System.

\subsubsection{System Enclosure}
This component is present to enclose the system. Typically, the material of this enclosure is a form of wave-reflective metal. The purpose of the enclosure is such that the waves create a destructive interference in the direction that it is not desired to go towards, and creates an amplified constructive interference in the direction that it is desired in. 

\subsubsection{Hardware Display System}
This component is for the user to understand when the device is operational, functional, etc. The current display system is under development, however, the use of LEDs will most likely be implemented. 

\subsubsection{Circuits & Logic}
This will consist of any circuitry required for proper control and use of the overall system.

\section{Conclusion}
Designing a software system is an intricate process, one that requires an inhuman-like insight into the very minute details of various sub-systems, independently nuanced and dependently coupled. For these reasons, they often contain far more mistakes and vulnerabilities than their proud creators suspect or even care to believe. This fact underlines the importance of acknowledging our faults and the likely faults of our current designs, which in turn allows us to not only protect against them but also further iterate on our pre-existing plans for development. By highlighting these hazards, we have been forced to further understand and define the constraints that are laid around our problem space, and how we might work to achieve all of them and the safest system possible. It is also important to notice the cyclical nature of data flow in our system, which can be seen in the various diagrams showing our system context in SRS Rev 0; thus our software system is especially vulnerable to the propagation of errors, and to the injection of poor data. In looking at the vulnerabilities we have been forced to understand the internal communications of all of our main components - the nature of their coupling as well as their own modular behaviour. The state of our problem definition, goals, and development plan are all better for it.
